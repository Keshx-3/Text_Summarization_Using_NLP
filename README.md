# Text_Summarization_Using_NLP

This project demonstrates text summarization using NLP techniques and the Hugging Face Transformers library. It processes a given text, extracts important keywords, and provides a concise summary using deep learning models.

## Project Overview

In a world where vast amounts of textual data are generated every day, summarizing this information effectively is crucial. This project uses Python and the spaCy library for text processing, combined with the Hugging Face Transformers library for deep learning-based summarization, specifically the `t5-base` model. The model is capable of generating summaries by understanding the context and content of the provided text.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses `spaCy` to clean and tokenize text, remove stopwords, and extract important keywords.
- **Frequency-based Scoring**: Calculates the frequency of words to score sentences based on their importance.
- **Deep Learning-based Summarization**: Utilizes the `t5-base` model from Hugging Face Transformers for generating a concise and accurate summary.
- **Flexibility**: Capable of summarizing various types of text data with customizable parameters such as the length of the summary.
